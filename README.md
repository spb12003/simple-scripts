# simple-scripts

This repository is to hold my simple scripts and projects.

What I have so far:
1. file-opener.py and web-opener.py are two very simple python scripts that open files from my computers files and opens webpages on a browser, respectively.
   Every month I go through my finances: credit cards, bank accounts, rental properties and everything else which required me opening 7 different websites and
   6 excel spread sheets. Now I can click these scripts and boom! i'm ready to get going.
